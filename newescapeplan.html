          <p> Anjeza listens to Harley and they head back to the stairway where they encounter the royal guard waiting. They try to head back out but not before one of the guards shoots Ben. The guards yell for them to surrender and that they are now surrounded. Anjeza, Harley and Jordyn surrender and raise their hands. However, the guards failed to notice the device in Anjeza’s hands, who wickedly smiles before hitting the red button and the entire building BLOWS UP! Everyone is down (including the robbers), including the royal guard who have stormed the bank and were making their way up to the rooftop.
