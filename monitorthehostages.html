          <p>You're pretty confident about your skills huh?</p>
          <p>Big mistake. The sounds of sirens are heard outside, followed by helicopters. The criminals are unphased by it. But one ballsy hostage makes a run for it and dashes through the bank in search of another possible exit to freedom. Dammit. What should the next move be?</p>
