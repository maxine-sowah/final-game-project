            Anjeza enlists Jordyn to help her look for the person. They hear someone’s footsteps coming from one of the offices of the bank. They storm into the room and spot the woman trying to pry the exit door open. Jordyn shoots a warning shot right above the woman’s head. The woman raises her hands and surrenders. Anjeza and Jordyn take her back to where the hostages are located. She searches the woman, only to find Harley’s weapons and a Winterfell royal guard badge. Problem has been solved…
