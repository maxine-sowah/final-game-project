          <p>Explaining the situation to the hostages</p>
          <p>The five and the hostages are now settled in the lobby of the bank. Harley collects all of their cell phones and anything they can use to connect to the outside world. Many of them are crying and panicking, scared that this will be their last moments. Anjeza assures them that no one has to get hurt if they simply stay put. Anjeza wants no bloodshed, just to send her family a message. But deep down she is willing to do anything to get her revenge. </p>
          <p>Jordyn proposes they tie up the hostages for their own safety, but Anjeza does not want make the hostages more uncomfortable and scared (I mean armed robbers would make anyone uncomfortable).</p>
