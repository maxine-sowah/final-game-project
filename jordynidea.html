    <title>Taking over the Bank</title>
      
      <body>
          <p>I'm guessing you like getting straight to the point huh?</p>
          <p>The five of them storm the bank! Benjamin shoot out the cameras, whilst the women threaten and gather their (now) hostages. They gather them to one side of the bank, whilst Harley and Jordyn scour the top floor of the bank to make sure everyone occupying the bank is accounted for. Everything is going to plan. All they have to do is get the money and go, but will it be that easy?</p>
          
          <p>Jordyn's idea may have gone pretty smoothly. But something those five don't know is that they missed one... a woman. Hiding in the vent of the bathroom.</p>
