      <body>
          <p> The robbers (along with the money) are heading to the rooftop where the helicopter is waiting. However, Harley and Anjeza senses something is off. As they make their way to the chopper, Harley tells Anjeza that the “pilot” in the chopper is actually her old coworker from when she was in the royal guard and not just a random pilot. Anjeza says the pilot would not try anything but Harley is skeptical.

          <p>Should they just go into the chopper and be ready for whatever happens? Or should they go back in the bank and figure out a new escape plan?
