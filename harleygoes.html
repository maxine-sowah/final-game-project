So you chose Harley… okay not bad. Harley is a trained ex-royal soldier so good choice!  She heads down the corridor, quiet as a mouse. She hears the sound again and stops her movements. She looks to her left and notices one of the vents rattling. She hides behind a wall and sees a woman come jump out of the vent. Harley comes out from behind the wall and attacks the woman.

          <p>However, after a struggle, the woman is finally able to overpower Harley and strangles her until she becomes unconscious. The woman takes Harley’s weapons as well as the earpiece that Harley uses to communicate with her fellow robbers…
