          <p>Ben searches for Harley after realizing she is taking a while. He takes his weapon and goes down the corridor and sees Harley unconscious in the middle of the hallway. He dashes towards her and brings her over to a room and informs Anjeza that Harley is down. 

            

          </p>
          
          <p>Anjexa is furious. Ben informs her that there is someone unaccounted for in the bank. Should she go look for this person or donâ€™t risk it?
