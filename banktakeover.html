          <p>We shall begin the heist...</p>
          <p>Anjeza and her gang are in the parking garage of the bank. They pose as the cleaning crew of the bank in order to get past security. Jordyn proposes they just storm the bank violently, but Anjeza and Harley think that is a bad idea. They want to just go in as the cleaning crew and act as janitors for a little bit as to avoid any suspicion from the highly armed security. Liam and Benjamin both vote for Jordyn's idea.</p>
