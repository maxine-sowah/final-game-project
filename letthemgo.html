The hostage ends up escaping and running straight into the Winterfell police guard. The guards raise their weapons ready to shoot. The hostage yells out that he is in fact a hostage and not one of the robbers. The guards are wary but violently handcuff him. The police still donâ€™t know exactly who are the robbers. They then question the man who tells them everything they know including detailed descriptions of how they look.
