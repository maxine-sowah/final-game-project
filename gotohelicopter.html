          <p> They decide to head to the helicopter, after all the royal guard wouldn’t want to risk the lives of their hostages or so they thought…

          <p>What the robbers don’t know is the amount of snipers hidden in the buildings around them. One of them shoots Harley in the shoulder and the rest are shot down. Ben is dead. Jordyn is critically injured. Anjeza tries dragging Jordyn back to the staircase, but she is shot as well. She knows no one will make it so she takes a device from the pocket of her vest and presses the giant red button and the entire building BLOWS UP! Everyone is down (including the robbers), including the royal guard who have stormed the bank and were making their way up to the rooftop.
