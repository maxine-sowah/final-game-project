Anjeza and the rest of the team have secured the money and now they must escape this bank unscathed. Anjeza dials the number to the royal guard. They answer and demand Anjeza to identify herself, which she proudly does. She demands them to send a helicopter for their escape or else they will begin killing the hostages. The guard approves. They can not afford to lose any hostages or else Winterfell will be in an uproar and the royal family will face backlash. After all they only care about their imageâ€¦

          <p>However, as they begin making their escape, Anjeza notices that some of the money is missing! She believes one of her team members is a traitor. She is furious. However, Liam brings up the woman that is lingering in the bank and blames it on her. Who do you think it is? Harley? Liam? Jordyn? Ben? Liam?
